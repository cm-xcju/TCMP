# Real-time Emotion Pre-Recognition in Conversations with Contrastive Multi-modal Dialogue Pre-training
 Thanks for your stay in this repo.
 This project aims to pre-recognize the real-time emotion in multimodal conversation [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3583780.3615024)

# 🔎 Motivation
The objective is to predict the emotion of a forthcoming target
utterance that is highly likely to occur. We believe that this task can
enhance the dialogue system’s understanding of the interlocutor’s
state of mind, enabling it to prepare an appropriate response in
advance.
